synopsis: Switch to using XDG directories
prs: #7386
issues: #680
significance: significant

description: {

Cabal/cabal-install now uses the XDG Base Directory Specification to
store configuration, caches, and the store.  Specifically,
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cabal` stores the configuration file,
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cabal` stores downloaded packages and similar, and
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/cabal` mainly contains the store of compiled
packages.  Further, `cabal install will put executables in
`~/.local/bin` by default.

The `dist`/`dist-newstyle` directories are not affected.

On Windows, these XDG paths are mapped to other (hopefully)
appropriate locations.  See the Cabal User Guide for information.

If the `CABAL_DIR` environment variable is set, the indicated
directory will be used to store all Cabal-related files, as in
previous versions.

Backwards compatibility: If `~/.cabal` already exists, this will be
interpreted as `CABAL_DIR=~/.cabal`.  This means that upgrading on an
existing system already using cabal-install should not cause any
change in behaviour.  An existing system can be migrated by deleting
`~/.cabal` (possibly copying `~/.cabal/config` to
`~/.config/cabal/config` first).
