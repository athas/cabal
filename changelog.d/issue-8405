Things like `PAGER="less -FX" cabal man` work now.

There's a slight change in the default behavior. We still use `less -R` as the default,
but if the user passes `PAGER=less`, we won't add -R to that, unlike before. This is
reasonable, as the user should be able to set the variable as they see fit.
